sentence=An FFT and IFFT library.
paragraph=There's no other one with IFFT so I made my own! Also includes a 2-way polar conversion (can be used for LED spectographs). IFFT is usefull for creating sfx. you may need a board with a lot of memory sometimes. I recomend the teensy 4.x for its speed and large amount of RAM (its very fast with a default of 600MHZ and a max built-in overclock of 1.024GHZ with cooling/heatsink).
